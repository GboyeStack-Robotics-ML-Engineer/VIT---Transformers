# Vision Transformer-Based Image Classification

This project implements a custom neural network inspired by the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for image classification tasks. By leveraging the power of transformers and the patch-based approach, this model offers a novel way to process and analyze images. The core idea is to split images into smaller patches, extract meaningful features using a pre-trained model like ResNet, and apply attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships within the image.

## Key Features
Patch-Based Image Processing: The model divides images into non-overlapping patches, allowing for localized feature extraction and processing.
Pre-Trained Embedding Model: Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet (or similar) to generate rich embeddings for each image patch, ensuring robust feature representation.
Multi-Head Self-Attention: Implements the attention mechanism across multiple heads to focus on different parts of the image simultaneously, enhancing the model's ability to understand context.
Positional Encoding: Integrates positional encodings to maintain spatial information within patches, crucial for capturing the structural layout of the image.
Flexible Design: The network is highly modular, enabling easy adjustments to the number of patches, embedding dimensions, and the attention mechanism.
Visualization Tools: Includes methods to visualize the attention maps, providing insights into what the model focuses on during classification.
Applications
This model is designed for a variety of image classification tasks, particularly where understanding the spatial relationships and detailed features within an image is critical. It is well-suited for tasks in fields like medical imaging, satellite image analysis, and any domain requiring fine-grained visual understanding.
